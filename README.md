This is an official repository of End-to-end Lane Shape Prediction with Transformers.

I'm still working on the latest deadline and the code will be made public as soon as the end of the Nov.

As for the speed issue, like most papers we measured the average speed of a batch (any size that maximizes the speed performance) on the GPU (GTX 1080Ti).
(Updated at 2020 Nov. 16) Here we set the batch size = 16 to measure the average speed.

We'll add the speed measured on the mobile computing platform NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier later, so stay tuned!
